##Crud operations in Django

Inserting data in the database

For inserting data in the database from the front end we use <form> tag.
The method inside the form tag should be POST and action should have the path/name of the path.

for eg:

<form action="{% url 'addTask' %}" method="POST">
	<input name='task' />
	<button type="submit">Add</button>
</form>

Now in the views.py we enter:

def addTask(request):
	task = request.POST['task'] #task is the name that we gave to the <input> tag above
	Task.objects.create(task=task)
	return redirect('home')
 #here the first task is from the models.py and the second task is the variable which we defined "task = request.POST['task']"
# redirect() function as the name suggests redirects us to the home page which we name 'home' in the urls.py of project folder.
